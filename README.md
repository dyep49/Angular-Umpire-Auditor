#Umpire Auditor

After every game, the MLB releases an incredible amount of data. In fact, every single pitch brings back more than 30 different characteristics. Umpire Auditor uses this data to track (or audit) the performance of MLB umpires, primarily by calculating the rate at which these umpires correctly calculate balls and strikes.

The application returns the worst call of the night, every night, chosen as such for being the called strike furthest from the strike zone. In addition, umpire performance statistics are calculated for each game and cumulatively. A task is run everyday at 8:30 AM eastern that updates and tweets the worst call from @umpireauditor. The gifs are not made programatically and are pretty much created whenever I wake up/get into work that day.
